## Project Scope

Our team is developing a 2D Multiplayer Trivia Game which has real time question and answer feature. At the end of the sprint we aim to present a playable game with a multi player room and basic game play.

#### Key Features/Deliverables:

- Real-time question-based gameplay
- Scoreboard and winner announcement
- Start screen and instructions
- Multiplayer waiting room (using socket or shared session logic).
- Design and asset embedding for improved UX.

#### Out of Scope (for now):

- User login/authentication
- Customizable avatars
- Advanced leaderboard or analytics

## Milestones and Timeline

1. Our key checkpoints are related to the learning units:
2. Define project scope
3. Create out your GitHub repo and set up branch workflow.
4. Plan out architecture and use GitHub Copilot.
5. Implement question logic and scoring
6. Basic multiplayer room setup
7. Have a working version for the demo.
8. Add animations, audio, and responsive UI
9. Debug and refactor game logic
10. Polish UI/UX
11. Write README, walkthrough notes
12. Prepare for demo day

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

Our team has 3 members which is why we divided the work based on each of our strengths which we then coordinated flexibly throughout the sprint.

### Nidhish Agarwal (Me)

**Role**: Principal Developer.

**Responsibilities**:

- Develop core gameplay logic
- Add GitHub Copilot changes to codebase.
- Handle debug issues and sort out complex edge cases.

### Issac Reji

**Role**: UI and UX Designer Frontend Developer.

**Responsibilities**:

- Develop UI elements with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Add graphics, transitions, and design improvements.
- Make the layout responsive for all devices.

### James R Jacob

**Role**: Manager of GitHub and Asset Integration.

**Responsibilities**:

- Set up the GitHub project and pull request process.
- Add and manage your assets which may be images, sounds, and libraries.
- Support development, repair of issues, and fine tuning.

### Coordination Plan

1. Daily updates on G-Chat.
2. Use the GitHub Projects board for task tracking.
3. Googleâ€™s meet for sync ups and debugging twice a week.
4. Roles are determined but we support each other as required.

## Anticipated Challenges and Strategies

### Challenges:

- Merge conflicts on GitHub

- Unfamiliarity with Copilot suggestions

- Time constraints due to parallel assignments

- Difficulty debugging multiplayer logic

### Stratergies:

- Use separate branches for development and review them together before merge.

- Spend some time on prompt patterns and their outputs.

- Plan in phases with buffer time, daily.

- Keep up with your code backups and debug in pairs.
